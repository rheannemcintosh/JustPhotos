# JustPhotos :camera_flash:

## Project Overview
JustPhotos is an application to store and share photos, built using Laravel 8 and Vue.js. The application is based off a Udemy Tutorial which can be accessed [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/laravel-masterclass-build-web-apps-with-laravel-7-php/). This was developed as part of my **365 Days of Code Challenge**.

## Initial Work
The initial work is still underway, but currently the application uses Laravel 8 and Vue.js.
